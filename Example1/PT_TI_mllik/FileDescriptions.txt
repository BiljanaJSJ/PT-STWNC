Subdirectory diffNuChains contains two subsubdirectories to calculate marginal likelihooh via TI-PT with 60 and 100 chains
chains60                                - run TI-PT using 60 chains
chains100                               - run TI-PT using 100 chains
AnalyzeChains.R                         - run diagnistics on the chains 
chain_diagnostics.RData                 - stored results from the diagnistics on the chains
